# Hyperskill_Android_BasicCalculator

This was the 1st project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's Android course.

The goal is to make a basic calculator.
It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It has plenty of limitations still, so please don't use it as an actual calculator!
