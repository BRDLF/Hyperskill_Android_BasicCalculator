### Stage 1/4: The layout

This is my first foray into Android dev work. The first hurdle is getting familiar with the ecosystem. How it all works.
So far, it seems really similar to HTML, just working on frontend. "Making things pretty" and so forth. \
I am really bad at it, turns out! \
Maybe that's wrong. Rather, I'm very inexperienced at it. Horizontally aligning these buttons is a hassle. The lessons from the course imply they want me to use nested LinearLayouts to form rows and then cells.
But when adding padding to the buttons, they become askew. The alternative is to use a GridLayout, but in order to use rowWeight/columnWeight, I need to set the minimumAPI to 21 and not 20 like required in the course.
I plan on becoming more familiar with the Constrained Layout and using constrainedRowWeight etc, but that will come in due time. For now it's a bit of an uneven ugly mess. I just want to put something out for right now.
